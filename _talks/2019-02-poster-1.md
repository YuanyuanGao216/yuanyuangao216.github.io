This is the first work reporting that the FLS scores, which are employed in surgical certification, could be predicted via fNIRS technique when using machine learning algorithms with a high degree of accuracy. The results indicate that fNIRS technique combined with machine learning algorithms could be potentially applied to monitoring and predicting surgical motor performance in real-time, thus to improve surgical safety.
