I contributed to the general education of the neuroimaging field by composing a comprehensive review paper on neuroimaging studies, including fNIRS, fMRI, EEG, PET, and MEG modalities, on how those neuroimaging techniques revealed human motor learning nature and how transcranial electrical stimulation affects it. This work is well received by peer scholars.
