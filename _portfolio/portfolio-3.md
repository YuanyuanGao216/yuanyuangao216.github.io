I successfully predicted the learning curve characteristics from the initial ten trials performance of the medical students (R2 = 0.81) by employing the machine learning approach, KPLS. I further classified the students into two groups with unique learning characteristics through an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, k-means algorithm, revealing the motor learning nature of human.
