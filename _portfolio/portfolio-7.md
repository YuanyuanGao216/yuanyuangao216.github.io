- Undertook project prophase investigation, proposed solutions with widely various ideas;
- Access mechanism system were analyzed, and optimal scheme of improvement was given through ADAMS software;
- The stress static and dynamic analysis and vibration analysis of elevator system were given using ANSYS software, and improve the structure to enhance the rigidity strength and vibration performance;
- Mechanical structure design of prototype experimental platform using SolidWorks software and participate in the process of manufacture;
- Debugged the system prototype using PLC, programmed the PC management software using C#.NET, program genetic algorithm to optimize the simulation calculation to the storage location assignment by Matlab.
