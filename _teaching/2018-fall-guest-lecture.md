At RPI I have continued to hone my teaching skills by giving guest lectures in Modeling of Biomedical Systems (BMED 4200). These invited lectures afforded me the opportunity to teach classes by introducing real lab research problems into the classroom and present how they were solved by the theories and models learned from the class.
