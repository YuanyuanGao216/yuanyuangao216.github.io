I was an undergraduate mentor in Undergraduate Research Program (URP) at RPI for one spring semester and the following summer semester. I mentored four undergraduate students from sophomores to juniors. I designed the independent research topic for each student and led weekly group meetings as well as one-on-one meetings. I guided them to learn literature review, defining the specific aims and hypothesis, setting up models, coding, scientific report writing and presentation.
